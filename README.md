Company classification project

We completed this project in a special topics course.
The idea of the project is to train a model to classify companies based on their names and descriptions.

We extracted the data from the Monshaat website.
The mon2 file contains the code we used to extract the data, while the monModels file shows how we trained one of the models on the extracted data.
The results were not satisfactory due to the limited amount of data.
